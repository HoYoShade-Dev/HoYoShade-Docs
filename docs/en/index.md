features:
  - title: ‚ôªÔ∏èResponsible, Sustainable, Fully Open Source
    details: Continuously updated and maintained, real-time tracking of upstream ReShade source code updates, all to ensure you can enjoy all new features at the first time. At the same time, the frameworks used by HoYoShade are 100% open source, we will not add any form of backdoor, nor will we save your data in any form. You can freely review all source code at any time to confirm that we do what we say.
  - title: üöÄMore versatile, easier to use, and multi-linked
    details: A brand new, reliable, scalable, and adaptive injector, ‚åàThe butterfly of Hong Kong‚åã, has been developed. It requires no configuration files; simply launching the game will complete all the previously tedious steps, reducing the learning curve. This also allows for chained launches, meaning you can always find a way to launch HoYoShade with it, regardless of the mod you're using.
  - title: ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí•Offline, Anti-Blockade, Anti-Censorship
    details: Network connection requirements are always optional. Even in high-pressure environments, most functions of HoYoShade will always be available. In some countries and regions with restricted international networks, HoYoShade will provide reliable local download methods, and also provide better availability and reliability than official ReShade.
  - title: üá≠üá∞Free, Open, Born in Hong Kong
    details: Unless you actively share your data with us, or you submit issues to us, we will never ask you for any form of data in any way. At the same time, the main development and maintenance work is completed in Hong Kong. For some sensitive operations, we will cooperate with our partners to ensure that our activities always remain anonymous.
