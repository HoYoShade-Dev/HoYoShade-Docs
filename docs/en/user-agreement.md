# HoYoShade User Agreement (Official)

> Updated: 2025-10-07

This User Agreement ("Agreement") applies to the HoYoShade / ⌈The butterfly of Hong Kong⌋ injection core project developed and published by members of DuolaDStudio Hong Kong Ltd. and its open-source community contributors (collectively, "the Project Team" or "we"). It also applies to derivative versions based on this project. Please read this Agreement carefully and in full before installing, downloading, or otherwise using HoYoShade. By installing, launching, or otherwise using the software, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all terms of this Agreement.

## 1. Definitions

- "Software" or "the Project" means HoYoShade and the ⌈The butterfly of Hong Kong⌋ injection core, together with all included files, resources, documentation and related tools.
- "User" means any individual or organization who downloads, installs, runs, or otherwise uses the Software.

## 2. License

The Project is distributed under the BSD-3 open-source license (see "Open Source License (BSD-3)" below). Subject to the BSD-3 license terms, you may copy, modify, and distribute the Software. Note that BSD-3 is a permissive license that allows commercial use, redistribution, and closed-source distribution.

Important reminder: If you intend to place additional restrictions on usage (for example, banning commercial use or restricting use for research only), you must explicitly state that in your project declaration. Any restriction that conflicts with the BSD-3 license may be unenforceable. If you need to prohibit commercial use legally, consider adopting a different license (e.g., CC BY-NC or a custom license) and consult legal counsel before publishing.

## 3. Risk Notice and Disclaimer

1. Risk of use: Using the Project's source code/build artifacts/releases may pose risks to your device hardware/software, miHoYo/HoYoverse game clients and accounts, including but not limited to accelerated wear or damage to hardware/software; game crashes, unstable performance, or client corruption; account risk such as detection, restrictions, or bans. You understand and voluntarily assume all risks and consequences arising from the use of the Software.
2. Limitation of liability: To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Project Team and contributors shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive or consequential damages arising out of the use of or inability to use the Software.
3. No warranty: The Software is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

## 4. Prohibited Conduct

Unless expressly permitted by the original author, you must not:

- Integrate, repackage or publish copyrighted assets from this Project (including but not limited to shader/effect libraries provided by contributors) into other closed-source or paid products without written permission;
- Use the Project to carry out unlawful, illicit, or rights-infringing activities;
- Use the Project in ways that violate game publisher policies or harm in-game balance (including but not limited to producing cheats using the ⌈The butterfly of Hong Kong⌋ injection core);
- Distribute the Project's artifacts in a way that supplies them "as-is" on commercial marketplaces without appropriate compliance with the chosen license;
- Remove or alter author or contributor attribution and copyright information in the Project or its derivatives, except where permitted by law or with written consent of primary contributors.

Note: The above are community and ethical expectations set by the Project Team. The actual legal rights are governed by the BSD-3 license adopted by the Project.

Violation of these prohibitions (especially violating BSD-3 terms or removing attribution) may expose violators to warnings, takedown notices, or legal action under applicable laws, including Hong Kong law, the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), or other jurisdictions' laws.

## 5. Intellectual Property

Except as expressly stated, the copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights in the Project remain with the Project Team or the respective rights holders. Your compliance with this Agreement and the open-source license grants only the right to use the Software and does not transfer ownership of any rights.

## 6. Third-Party Components

The Project may include third-party open-source components or binary libraries that are subject to their own licenses. Unless otherwise stated, third-party components' licenses and responsibilities are borne by their rights holders, and you must comply with those licenses when using those components.

## 7. Modifications and Redistribution

Any modifications, derivative works or redistributions of the Project must comply with the BSD-3 license: retain appropriate copyright and license notices and, when applicable, provide source code as required by the target license.

## 8. Community and Contributions

We welcome community participation and contributions. Contributions to the Project (including but not limited to code, documentation, and assets) are generally considered to be licensed to the Project Team under BSD-3 (see CONTRIBUTING or any contributor agreement in the repository for specifics). If you have special requirements regarding rights or licensing of your contribution, contact the maintainers and obtain written agreement before contributing.

## 9. Termination

If you breach this Agreement or applicable law, the Project Team may terminate or suspend your right to use the Software at any time. Termination does not affect rights or liabilities accrued prior to termination.

## 10. Changes to the Agreement

This Agreement may be revised by the Project Team from time to time. Revised terms published on the Project homepage or release pages take effect for future use. For already distributed releases, the Agreement applicable is the text bundled with that release.

## 11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

This Agreement is governed by the laws of Hong Kong (or the jurisdiction of the project maintainers). Disputes arising from this Agreement should be resolved by friendly negotiation first. If negotiation fails, disputes may be submitted to courts or arbitration with proper jurisdiction under applicable law.
